            Your browser does not support WebGL!
            <br /><br />
            It is a period of digital strife.
            Internet users, navigating
            through cyberspace, face
            obstacles hindering their quest.
            <br /><br />
            Amidst the chaos, a rebel coder
            discovers the secrets of a powerful
            web tool, WebGL, capable of
            creating immersive experiences.

            fearing its potential to liberate
            users from their digital shackles.

            seeking allies in the Firefox Rebellion
            and the Chrome Coalition,
            hoping to bring WebGL to all browsers
            and restore freedom to the web...
