    "The radius of a circle is a line segment that extends from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference. It essentially measures the distance from the center to the edge of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition of Radius in Mathematics:**\n",
    "   In geometry, the radius ($r$) of a circle is defined as the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference. This distance remains constant throughout the circle. Mathematically, if we consider the Cartesian coordinate system, and if the center of the circle is at the origin (0,0), then any point on the circumference can be represented as ($x$, $y$). Using the distance formula in the Cartesian plane, the radius $r$ can be calculated as:\n",
    "   $$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n",
    "   If the circle's center is not at the origin, we can adjust the formula accordingly by subtracting the coordinates of the center from those of the point on the circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formulas Relating Radius, Diameter, and Circumference:**\n",
    "   - **Diameter ($d$):** The diameter of a circle is the longest chord that passes through the center of the circle, and it is exactly twice the length of the radius. Mathematically, the diameter is given by:\n",
    "    $$d = 2r$$\n",
    "   - **Circumference ($C$):** The circumference of a circle is the distance around its edge. It is directly proportional to the radius and can be calculated using the formula:\n",
    "     $$C = 2 \\pi r$$\n",
    "     where $\\pi$ (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. This formula arises from the relationship between the circumference and the diameter of a circle, which is $C = \\pi d$, and substituting $d = 2r$ yields the formula $C = 2 \\pi r$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These formulas are fundamental in various mathematical and scientific disciplines, particularly in geometry, trigonometry, and physics. They are used extensively in calculations involving circles and circular motion."
