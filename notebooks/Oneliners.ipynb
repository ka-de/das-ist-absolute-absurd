    "\n",
    "A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The lambda function returns `True` if the input string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise."

    "- `a, b = b, a`: This line simultaneously assigns the value of `b` to `a` and the value of `a` to `b`. This is achieved through tuple unpacking, where the right side creates a tuple `(b, a)` and the left side unpacks it into the variables `a` and `b`.\n",

It takes advantage of the fact that the right side creates a tuple, and the values are then unpacked and assigned to the respective variables on the left side. After this line executes, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped."
