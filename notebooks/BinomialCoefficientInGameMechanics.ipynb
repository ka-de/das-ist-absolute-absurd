    "1. **Import Statements:**\n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   import (\n",
    "       \"fmt\"\n",
    "       \"math/big\"\n",
    "       \"math/rand\"\n",
    "       \"time\"\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Import necessary packages: `fmt` for formatted I/O, `math/big` for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, `math/rand` for random number generation, and `time` for seed generation based on the current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Binomial Coefficient:**\n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   func binomialCoefficient(n, k int) *big.Int {\n",
    "       // Check for invalid inputs\n",
    "       if k < 0 || k > n {\n",
    "           return big.NewInt(0)\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       // Optimize k for computation\n",
    "       if k > n-k {\n",
    "           k = n - k\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       // Calculate binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n",
    "       result := big.NewInt(1)\n",
    "       for i := 0; i < k; i++ {\n",
    "           result.Mul(result, big.NewInt(int64(n-i)))\n",
    "           result.Div(result, big.NewInt(int64(i+1)))\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       return result\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `binomialCoefficient` function calculates the binomial coefficient \\(C(n, k)\\) using the formula. It takes two integers \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) as input and returns a pointer to a `big.Int` representing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Success Probability:**\n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   func calculateSuccessProbability(luck, totalAttempts, successfulAttempts int) float64 {\n",
    "       // Using binomial coefficient for probability calculation\n",
    "       comb := binomialCoefficient(totalAttempts, successfulAttempts)\n",
    "       successProbability := float64(comb.Int64()) * (float64(luck) / 100.0) * (1.0 / float64(totalAttempts))\n",
    "\n",
    "       return successProbability\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `calculateSuccessProbability` function utilizes the `binomialCoefficient` function to calculate the probability of success in opening a treasure chest. The probability is influenced by the player's luck, total attempts, and the required number of successful attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simulate Opening the Treasure Chest:**\n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   func openTreasureChest(luck, totalAttempts, successfulAttempts int) bool {\n",
    "       rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\n",
    "\n",
    "       successProbability := calculateSuccessProbability(luck, totalAttempts, successfulAttempts)\n",
    "       randomNumber := rand.Float64()\n",
    "\n",
    "       return randomNumber <= successProbability\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `openTreasureChest` function simulates the player attempting to open the treasure chest. It sets the seed for the random number generator based on the current time, calculates the success probability, generates a random number, and returns `true` if the random number is less than or equal to the success probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Main Function:**\n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   func main() {\n",
    "       // Player's luck (percentage)\n",
    "       playerLuck := 20\n",
    "\n",
    "       // Number of attempts to open the treasure chest\n",
    "       totalAttempts := 5\n",
    "\n",
    "       // Number of successful attempts needed for a rare item\n",
    "       successfulAttempts := 3\n",
    "\n",
    "       // Simulate opening the treasure chest\n",
    "       successful := openTreasureChest(playerLuck, totalAttempts, successfulAttempts)\n",
    "\n",
    "       // Display the outcome\n",
    "       if successful {\n",
    "           fmt.Println(\"Congratulations! You found a rare item in the treasure chest.\")\n",
    "       } else {\n",
    "           fmt.Println(\"Better luck next time. No rare item found in the treasure chest.\")\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - In the `main` function, values for the player's luck, total attempts, and successful attempts are set. The opening of the treasure chest is simulated using the `openTreasureChest` function, and the outcome is displayed based on whether the attempt was successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with different values for luck, total attempts, and successful attempts to observe how they affect the probability of finding a rare item in the treasure chest. If you have any specific questions or if there's anything you'd like further clarification on, feel free to ask!"
